Hi there!

My name is Andreas, and I'm building a robot that can play Table Soccer against my kids. I have a background in Computer Science and have worked professionally as a Software Engineer and Data Scientist. 

I will be documenting the work I am doing, which will include things like

* setting up this blog 
* tracking the players and the ball
* building the hardware to control the players

While I have plenty of experience in software development, hardware is new to me, so I am looking forward to learning something entirely new!

I hope you enjoy reading!
